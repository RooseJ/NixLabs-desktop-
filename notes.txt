May try using try and except so code doesnt throw errors

Change the defaults for base folder
Create a commands list for the terminals

For fixing errors:

- Add a check feature to check if imported file is the right format

- Figure out why a new instance of tkinter window is being created when I switch between open sim and create sim windows

- Make import to not move files randomly (done)

- Make import to not store file and only get info from file
